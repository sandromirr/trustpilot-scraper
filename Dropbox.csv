I was told that in a year I would revert to the basic package  which beware is not a straight out cancellation it could  become live if you skip emails etc they can take out another subscription. I asked Dropbox to make sure my PayPal account details were deleted I dont want my PayPal details held for over year by dropbox when I have cancelled.  I was told they would check with their payments team to see if that could be done  Surely it is my consumer right in the UK At no time did they suggest I cancel my billing agreement with my own PayPal account..which I did I see lots of people have had the same trouble Totally unprofessional you have to wonder if board members like Condoleeza Rice know what is actually going on.  Am finding out if this is fraudulent in the uk F M

T Grant,NO photo,GB,1 star: Bad,Do not trust. A Ransomeware trap in Google clothing.,Thought this app might be helpful but it is not what I need at all. It is far too complicated and it can delete files on your computer if you delete them in Dropbox. The chat lines are far too slow and there is no help as to how to uninstall the app without losing data anywhere on the Dropbox site. Furthermore after saying it would restore my Desktop icons to their original positions it jumbled them up and left them.This is as good as walking into a ransomware trap. AVOID at all costs.Also my fast computer has turned into a slug.
James landels,NO photo,GB,1 star: Bad,literally the worst system I have ever,literally the worst system I have ever come across in my life. weeks of distress and anxiety. I was tasked with uploading same test results onto drop box for work and so i downloaded it. somehow i inadvertently ticked a box that moved the entire contents of my computer onto the cloud while using twice the disk space I woke up in the morning and the only folder left on my computer in my USB stick. I followed online tutorials in order to restore my computer and it turns out that although all the files were gone from my computer I only had a basic package and my whole hard drive was stuck in syncing because i only had 2GB of space. I then had to download premium 199 just so i could sync the files in order to retrieve them from the cloud. once i managed to get the files back onto my computer Via a dropbox folder not on my HDD all the test results were disbursed into folders with names like 9BC875648 and i had to search for each one of 1120 results manually by date. this has taken 10 days. now that i have uploaded the files i am scared to uninstall incase it removes the files again and i have to start over. I have no idea how to get my files back into my HDD and uninstall. the support are no help. I wish i has never downloaded in the first place.

Andrew Todd,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/5d5ffadd7fae1a219e244a60/73x73.png,GB,1 star: Bad,Drop Box charge scam by Drop Box,Drop Box will be history. They are corrupt. Their practice of charging you 12 months and 3 licences rather than the one licence and or 3 licences and explaining that its the minimum amount and declaring the full amount upfront is amazing. Its then impossible to speak to anyone and its impossible to get a refund. So when you cancel they then delete all your data which you have had on the basic service. The cancellation then confirms you wont be charged in 12 months time but they wont refund you. The refund page on their site just wont connect the chat box cant deal with it and the automated call services to get someone to call is the same. You receive an automated call you are put on hold for 10 minutes and cut off. You then receive an email stating they couldnt hear you. Ive used landline and two different mobiles. So its their avoidance strategy. Of course there is information on Google about it. I should of looked and checked first. So Be Aware .

Eventually I have to transfer my data all to somewhere else and completely delete the account to make sure others not stole my data.

Bob Bennett,NO photo,US,1 star: Bad,Dropbox proves itself to be unreliable,I have subscribed to Dropbox since they first appeared on the scene. I recommended them to many and although there have been some bumps they seemed to have worked them out. However in the past couple of years and weeks they have pulled the biggest blunder and turned me against them. A little more than 3 years ago I helped test and then they introduced showcase and since I helped test I was told I wouldnt have to pay the premium I was a Plus subscriber. A few months later they charged my account for Pro anyway and wouldnt back down on it. But theyd gotten me using Showcase and publishing links to it so I had to let them.So theyve been charging me double the price agreed to for about two years now but Id published the Showcase links to multiple organizations so it would cause a lot of work and embarrassment to pull them back or change them so I stayed. So now Dropbox completely drops Showcase with only a few weeks notice. They refuse to even grandfather the existing links and pages and also said they cant refund the extra charge for the Pro but theyve added premium features useless to me. When I do downgrade the price of the Plus plan has been cranked during this time so that will cost more also. While the unannounced and unexpected extra charges were bad enough the real problem is that they have now shown themselves to be unreliable and thats the worst part. As a paying subscriber I used features they promoted in a way that they promoted them to be used paid for the features then they dropped them with little notice. Very sad for the company. I think theyll be going out of business with such practices and Ill be looking for other services now.

Postscript: I have deleted the Dropbox app because I noticed my laptop battery was running down fast and when I clicked on the battery icon it said DropBox was the culprit. I have read this from other people as well. My iPad was also running down faster than ever so all DropBox apps have been deleted from all my four devices.

I signed up five years ago and am certain that I cancelled.  It is impossible to verify that you cancelled the service after you cancel.  You have to have open an account to have a live chat. Once you do that you may trigger the activation of a paid account again.  Before I cancelled again they sent me to a web site that does not have the cancel option claiming that you must have opened on a mobile app. That was certainly not true to the best of my knowledge.  I am not quite claiming fraudulent business practices but I would stay away from this company.  BTW even if you cancel your cc with them the cc company will accept your old card because they are an established business. You have to put a merchant block on DB to prevent being charged in the future.

Zachris Jntti,NO photo,FI,1 star: Bad,THEY WILL DELETE YOUR FILES FOR INACTIVITY,I had a long break from using Dropbox which contained all of my backup files from my studies at university. Dropbox deleted all of my files for having been inactive. Incredible. Exactly the opposite of what you should expect  in fact it would have been better not to have used Dropbox at all since all my files are now lost. To be fair Dropbox did inform me of this by email but I had just changed my email address and only found out when trying to access my backups that everything had been deleted. This policy should be something to tell potential customers UP FRONT before they set up an account. Wouldnt trust Dropbox at all after this will be using Google Drive. Extremely disappointing.

No warning. Then it messes up your files and folders in varied ways between machines. I successfully renamed a folder using the  character allowed by Windows. On the original machine it kept them in the correct newly named place all green ticks after a sync and then it updated correctly on the second Windows 10 machine but on the third Windows 10 machine it split my folder into two folders one old and new and distributed the contents into the two different places  this maybe was because the third machine couldnt update via LAN and had to use WAN but this shouldnt have made any difference.No warning message was issued by the app nor any explanation so i spent two hours on the chat to support in emergency panicking about where my files had gone. Once diagnosed they said they had decided not to do anything to their software  such as warning the user in a dialog  because it was 50 windows fault. Its not windows fault Windows allowed that character in a file name And even if it was Dropbox should have indicated it had a sync issue.  Plus once you have figured out after two hours whats happening you have to trawl through files to find the offending one and it isnt always directly in the exact subfolder caused solely by the problem you get unpredictable faults so its extremely hard to locate the issue. Also it used to stop the mobile app downloading for offline viewing but again it doesnt tell you nor does it tell you why and it stalls the updates on the app without telling you whenwhere or why In all these cases a warning to the user which also points to the file or folder causing the issue would be very simple to develop. It would solve the hours of panic and distress caused by wondering where my files had suddenly gone.

I pay for a premium service but definitely didnt get it. Somehow I lost some crucial data but wasnt worried as I knew Dropbox had a rollback feature which was part of my premium subscription. So I went in to use it and guess what  it didnt work. ArghI got in touch with support and they tried to help but couldnt. In the end I managed to get something back which wasnt as uptodate as I wanted but just had to make do.I spent the next few weeks arguing with Dropbox about having to pay for a feature that didnt work. I figured a bit of a credit on my account wouldnt go amiss but they refused point blank. They REALLY didnt care.It became one of those points of principles where I just wanted them to concede that features that people are paying for should work. If they dont work temporarily then that be accepted but I ended up being able to send them screen shots and videos clearly demonstrating that this premium feature didnt work. They really didnt care.Then a few months later I needed to restore another file. And guess what. It still didnt work as youd expect so all that time had gone by and they still havent fixed it properly.So alas like many other people it seems I am now looking to take my custom elsewhere as I am worried that there may come another time when I need to rely on Dropbox to recover data thats one of the main reasons for Dropbox right and it will fail to deliver again.

Consumer,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,I am so totally disappointed with DROPBOX,I am so totally disappointed with Dropbox Customer Service.  Our IT Company set up our Dropbox account which worked perfectly until we changed IT Companies.  They had set up the account in their name in lieu of ours and the cost was incorporated into our billing. Sounds like a simple change of plan ownership and billing but NOT WITH DROPBOX.  I have been working diligently for 3 months to get this rectified and it is still not resolved and I cannot find a live person in which to speak  EVERYTHING is handled by email or online chat and never the same person.  Obviously we have had to go around the Mulberry Tree several times and just as I think we are making progress it all changes again.  You would think they would want our business but apparently losing clients is not an issue for Dropbox.  I urge EVERYONE to change to another Storage Source as soon as possible.

Ive been paying good money for this thing for years and it cant do the one thing it needs to do  backup reliably. Im stuck with some folders on the web that wont sync to the local computer a service that inexplicably moves my dropbox folder and syncs it to nothing so that everything gets erased and a service that offers me completely useless extra features that Im not even remotely interested in. Im surprised they havent added a social media app or chat to it. Do one thing and do it well. You cant even do basic stuff like telling it to back up one folder NOW so it prioritises that so you can send it to a client and disconnect. Im currently trying to get this awful thing gone and migrate  but just getting everything off the cloud and local so I can back up with something else is a challenge in itself. This is the first piece of software that actually makes me angry. I realised it was time to go when I was manually backing up everything to other external drives  just in case dropbox decided to go into a meltdown and erase everything. The best thing Dropbox could do is press backspace repeatedly for the past 3 or 4 years until they had something that actually worked.

Dropbox after dozens of chat box and dozens of emails ignored me and just placed me on a circular of chat box and promises to have a senior specialist respond after three weeks and maybe 40 hours I gave up. A disgraceful technology company and a waste of the 200 I pay annually to ensure my data. I cannot understate how appalling and revolted I feel as an Australian consumer. Do not trust this flimsy tech enterprise. Ive lost all my medical and health records and two years of work on a project maybe 100000 or so in value.

Alexander,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Dropbox App is Awful,The Dropbox app is nothing more than an invasive clunky asinine by design program that should not be used whatsoever. This program takes all the files on your PC for some ungodly reason and forces them into its own files to make managing them easier... like I needed help managing images. To whoever has this app downloaded Uninstall immediately but PLEASE be careful as again this app shoves your computers files into its own. If you delete the Dropbox folder before emptying it first Chances are you may very well wind up deleting all your data without meaning to. In any event dont bother using this application.
Jennifer A.,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Customer service is abysmal,Customer service is virtually nonexistent.We signed up for a free business account trial. When the trial ended it put a lock on our PAID account and we did not know why it wasnt working. We reached out to customer service. They did respond and told us our account was locked because the trial had ended which is ridiculous b/c we were PAYING for it. They said they could not refund us for the months we could not use it but that they could refund us for the current month. Well since it began to work we figured out how to unlock the account at this point we wanted a refund for the prior month so we could actually use it  FINALLY. But they did not listen and only refunded us for the current month which downgraded our account. So now we could finally use the account weve been paying for for 5 months but we cant b/c they cancelled and refunded for the current month. AWFUL customer service. 0 stars. Seriously.

If anything ever goes wrong and you need any type of support it would be easier and faster to start your own cloud storage company raise capital find partners learn how to write code build engineering and product development... than it would be to get someone at dropbox to actually help. As a business customer you have a phone number to call which makes you feel good about support when youre signing up and paying. DB has gone the route of having very nice people answer the phones quickly to placate customers and have no answers. Engineers and team that can actually help are busy doing that understandably. Heres how it works: if you email email responses are only sent out 1X per day. Yes 1X per day. So in an email conversation you ask for help they ask you a follow up question tomorrow. You answer immediately they ask follow up question 2 the next day. And so on. I spend 13 days trying to simply restore one folder to a specific date a relatively simple and clear task and it NEVER happened. I had to abandon my data they never fixed the problem and I lost my data forever. I also invested about 1 hour per day during this 13 day stretch calling them and going absolutely no where. Very nice on the phone completely useless. If you need DB style sharing for business folders use Box or Google or ANYTHING literally anything. Your data is in real danger with DB. Anything ever goes wrong I know youre saying to yourself yea but Ill get a supervisor on the phone they cant just refuse to help me. They will not help you. I promise. Theyll smile and never do a single thing.

Isr deres device limit p tre enheder som blev indfrt tidligere i r er en stor klods om benet. Det er forsteligt at man nsker at begrnse brugen af den gratis version men s burde man have dette device limit implementeret fra dag t s man ikke kom til at genere eksisterende brugere.Den nye desktopklient har ogs et irriterende design. Frhen brugte klientprogrammet blot operativsystemets filhndteringsprogram men nu skal man absolut tvinges ind i dette bloatede software.Endelig er deres prisniveau for hjt da man kan f mere lagerplads for frre penge hos andre udbydere.Jeg giver dog tre stjerner da jeg har haft gavn af Dropbox i en rrkke og det altid har fungeret fint men jeg kan ikke lngere anbefale det.

MR ANTHONY FERNANDES,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Anthony Fernandes,My name is Anthony Fernandes I am full time employed and I dont have any business but to my surprise in year 2018 I got a debit on my credit card for 432 towards annual subscription for Dropbox business account.I never used to check my credit card transactions in detail and missed the transaction  but as I was reconciling my bank and credit card account for year end account I notice an Unknow transaction of Dropbox business account  annual subscription   Upon inquiry Dropbox informed they cannot refund the money even though I have not subscribed for Dropbox business account With this I have lost 432  on my credit account I have no idea how can I claim my money of 432  from Dropbox Uk  Can trustpilot or any other recovery agency help me to recover my money from Dropbox who has wrongly debited  432 from my credit card account  with out my consent I had reported to my credit card  but I was informed that they can only help to disburse transaction upto one year backwards However Dropbox can easily check that account does not exist and was not used at all and it was falsely debited from my account From a Depressed Citizen

The biggest reason to avoid this company at tall costs.....is because if you use them... you must give them permission to read and scan your own data AND it gets worse....third parties of their choice. This means you MUST give them permission to read your private information and share with whoever they like.  Many file storage/back up storage software companies are like this.  Sync.com honor your privacy so were talking to their sales team at the moment to see if theyre the right solution for us. Not secure not privacy friendly.  Not trustworthy.We left them quickly.

Reviewer101,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,A wonderful idea ruined by inept managers,Dropbox was a wonderful idea and it worked really well until they started packing it out with unwanted useless features and now they have wrecked it completely. Dropbox is now a very bad place to synch your precious data. The current problem is the unannounced uncontrollable One Time Update which their own techs do not fully understand and it is running wild across the entire Dropbox community destroying the very thing Dropbox was designed to do.I have been a user for about 8 years and I have two paid accounts costing 200 p.a.  I am closing them both. Try ownCloud as an alternative.EDIT 2nd March 2020  anyone thinking of buying space on Dropbox MUST look at the users forum and search for the thread Dropbox performing one time update  and read it through to the end.

Jaymes Kine,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Dropping Dropbox is Diabolically Difficult,The Dropbox team has clearly put a lot of effort into crafting the perfect user experience  for their cancellation/refund process. Their diabolical scheme includes multiple pages that include subtle nudges to confuse users into clicking buttons that lead them out of the cancellation funnel requiring them to restart from the beginning. Honestly its a beautiful example of how cleverly designed UI can influence user behavior. In this case however I believe its a clear indication of an overpriced product that doesnt present nearly enough value: they are obviously acutely aware of how often people want to cancel and so they went to great lengths to make it as difficult as possible. Oh and even if you do successfully navigate the entire downgrade process and all its cascading tabs its all but impossible to request a refund without asking your bank to do a chargeback. Kudos to you for the incredibly frustrating experience Dropbox. I know it took a lot of effort and it shows

Da bin ich berhaupt nicht einverstanden und wenn ich die Dropbox aufgebe dann wegen der komplizierten und unzureichenden Bedienung in der App. brigens ohne App via Homepage noch schlimmer Ich mchte es nicht unterlassen ein Beispiel zu geben. Nach dem Upload habe ich das Bedrfnis die Bilder zu betrachten Grossansicht du Bezeichnen und zu verschieben oder zu lschen. Es gibt keine Funktion die dieses Grundbedrfnis abdeckt. Entweder kann ich markieren oder ich kann die Bilder Betrachten. Dabei wre es aus Nutzersicht so einfach: Egal in welcher Sicht ich mich befinde stehen alle notwendigen Funktionen wie Betrachten lschen umbenennen verschieben usw. zur Verfgung. Aber nein nicht bei Dropbox. Jedes mal wenn ich die Dropbox benutze nerve ich mich schlussendlich nur ber diese Unprofessionalitt. Die Effizienz und das Vergngen bleibt aus. Da habe ich mich auch nach Jahren der Nutzung noch nicht daran gewohnt. Der Wechsel auf Google Drive ist fr mich keine Alternativ denn auch hier habe ich bereits Schwachstellen entdeckt. Zudem bedeutet ein Wechsel auf eine andere Cloud viel Arbeit. Einmal fr eine Cloud entschieden und die Datenmenge 2 Terra erreicht macht abhngig.
Mick,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Years of amazing service,Im in the UK and have been using dropbox pretty much since it launched many years ago now. I definitely signed up sometime within the first few months after launched  back when the domain was getdropbox.com.Anyway... in all those years Ive never had a problem. Its an incredible service thats never let me down. I really cant fathom all the 1 star reviews on here. Working in the technology sector myself I can only imagine that these people struggle in general with technology.

You cant speak with them and you can just communicate with them through emails and it takes them days to answer and you stuck without your files. It is definitely the worst customer service Ive ever got.
Dave,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Terrible,Terrible. Lost some of my folders containing hundreds of hours of work customer service/support was completely useless and didnt help. No technical support offered to resolve the issue or advice offered to avoid the same thing happening again  I was simply told they had no record of it uploading and that no refund was possible. The only possible explanation was your computer may have disconnected from the internet at some point which it will have because its a laptop that comes between work and home with me. Diana the agent on their chat service was particularly useless. Dont give this company your money they are totally useless and data preservation is not something they can achieve.

Kept getting very vague partial solutions to technical issues and then no response from them for ages its very frustrating waiting over two days for a reply only to have them respond with a non solution Sorry but Im not giving these guys over 100 a year if theyre not prepared or capable of solving problems with their software.Also was told that I cant upload large MP4 film files because the app wont run in the background Something to do with it not having a resume function  basically that translates to...... if Im uploading a file that takes for example 40 minutes and at any point during that upload my device screen turns off taking me out of the app then the upload fails and I have to start againWhats all that about....they must have some very basic software either at user level within their servers or both because Ive never heard of a cloud storage service and thats basically what this is that cannot handle and process large MP4 film files. They are saying its because Im doing it from my device and quote The network is not stable unquote. I did manage to fully upload a short 10 minute MP4 film that I had just to test it. After a successful but very slow upload 25 minutes the results when I streamed it were horrendous.......freezing pixelation sound dropouts sound out of sync buffering and a very poor quality picture The upload was HD.Ive got the Sendanywhere app and that copes with large uploads no problem and Ive also now installed Google drive and that too works perfectly. These guys need to seriously up their game if theyre going to stay in business. As mentioned previously Ive now installed Google drive for less money and with the same 2TB storage.... and to top it off it actually works and very well at that.I honestly expected Dropbox to be a really good application and service with good customer support to match how wrong I was. In all honesty you cant charge somebody for a service and then put them in the same queue for support enquiries as someone who is using the free version But that appears to be exactly how this company operates. Three days waiting for a support response when having technical problems with the product is NOT ACCEPTABLE.......IVE TAKEN MY CUSTOM TO GOOGLE DRIVE

Sure most recent 1star reviews are for the terrible nonexistent customer support and quite rightly that and the price increase.But for me the mobile app is terrible REALLY BAD  they cant be forgiven for a serious bug which means important photos you take when on holiday aka roaming will NOT get backed up. Its a BUG and not a feature as they call it to block uploading on 4G when in Europe 4G is faster and free compared to slow  expensive WiFi.So keep that in mind you can NOT rely on Dropbox FACT. AVOID the mobile app if photos are important to you whilst on holiday or touring another country  just when your photos are probably the most important youve taken

Then out of the blue no collaboration  price put up by 2 a month 20  And yes you are holding your customers hostage as you have all our files.  The way you announced the price was going up by default leaving the customers to sort out what they want to do and making it very difficult to find an alternative and cancel blah blah leaves a nasty feeling.  Remember what happened to the financial institutions when they treated customers like this  There was a very big comeback.  Just treat us with integrity and dont  exploit us.  And to anyone considering using you  Try a trustworthy alternative that values its customers and plays the long game rather than blind shortterm greed.

That was a lie I had 6 and I was forced to disconnect 3 from the service.I complained with no results and no consideration from them about their own policy.

There is not way for checking what happen. I was writing mails to support created 4 issues on their tracker they was just closed without any answer. Was creating topics on their forum no attention at all. Thats all for 10EUR a month. Worst service ever. Never again.

Also there seems to many irritating and time consuming issues to deal with  the fact it clogs up your disc space rendering computers unuseable. I thought the point was to have it all cloud based oh you need to pay more for that. But even to get everything uploaded at the outset to plan to smart sync chosen files after it takes 3 days to copy when the same data cpoied from HD to HD only takes 1 hour. Meanwhile access to files is disabled. They dont make this known when you pay upfront. Also the green tick has been showing on many main folders but when i click into subfolders many files are missing not  in a logical way just some from one sub folder some from another.....when i called to check this i was met with rudeness told that the green tick doesnt mean anything and that the files are not ready to use even when this tick shows like id made an irrational assumption....massive design flaw in my opinion. It should be simple to know when files are copied over or not and some form of visual marker so know which files are ready. Im eagerly searching a better alternative i hate giving money to arrogant rude companies who give a clunky bad product and service.

Redlkw,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Dropbox is ok unless you like simple controls and no real control of your storage,I am currently with Dropbox since 2014 and i can tell you that its trash. Do not pay for Dropbox at all. They offer 1TB for 9.99 compared to Google Drive 2TB for 9.99 and Onedrive offers a 6TB 6 user family plan for 9.99 that is very cool.  Also the management of your storage on the site is very limited. If you do not believe me. Well just right click on a folder in Dropbox and Google Drive and you notice the difference. Right Alot of more options on your on view correct You can also notice the cheap and boxy look of Dropbox compared to Onedrive or Google Drive.Also Dropbox lacks of a ecosystem. Dropbox is made for businesses only not personal use.My recommendation is use Google Drive or Onedrive. Both are a blessing to exist. Perfect management both services they give you. I highly recommend more Google Drive seeing that they own Android and you have Chrome also. OneDrive is build for people who have Windows operating system and Xbox One.My complain about Dropbox is that its basic no real management for your storage unless you are willing to pay 15 for the business 3TB one.

Several months ago I received a call from them stating that I was running out of space and needed more to save anymore information.  Since I was unsure of how much activity my wife was using I purchased some additional space to be billed monthly on my credit card.  A couple of months ago I realized I had plenty of unused space and could not find a way to cancel.  So I disputed the charges with my credit card company.  Apparently they know how to contact them.  I am still searching for a way to cancel my agreement and discontinue any further relationship with them.  Can anyone help

Our company has used Dropbox extensively in the past and had many accounts but have since moved on to using other better and cheaper cloud accounts. In the mists of time and changes to email accounts an active dropbox account was missed until we received an annual charge on a defunct and unused email account.I have been in contact with support for the last month trying to get a refund and have been fobbed off and downright lied to  they are now not even responding to requests. Take heed of the warnings here and avoid dropbox like the plague  it is utterly amazing that such a large high profile company behave like a bunch of back street scheisters.

BEFORE I COULD EVEN COMPLETE TYPING THIS the agent cut me off. A rate our service sign popped up with a space to type like this very page Im on right now.

My account was erroneously charged for an annual Dropbox charge and there is no one to talk to. It doesnt matter which button you push in their phone tree they will send you to their website and then hang up on you. I called sales because of course they will answer and was told there was no way she could help me other than send me to the website unless I had a premier account then I could talk to somebody but people with less than a premier account dont have the ability to talk to a live person. We havent used this Dropbox account in years and were surprised that we were still being charged 109 annually. We received an email that the credit card they had on file was not good anymore. This was true because of fraudulent activity the  account was closed it but somehow miraculously they still charged our account. We never updated our financial information.

We were not able to recover the files their system for doing is very time consuming and if you have a lot of data you may not notice right away what they deleted.

Security flows aside it does a terrible job managing space. If you need to reorganize 20mbs of your files on drobpox then your dropboxconnected computer will need to have 1gb of free space for that simple operation. I had a big account 1 Terabyte and guess what happened when I reorganized it I run out of space on my local space. I reorganized files on Dropbox in directories NOT connected to my computer  but it didnt matter. I had a 1/2 Terabyte hard drive and I had to remove everything from it in a continuing quest to try to have Dropbox finalize the few moves of files I made. Ive been at it for 2 days removing all my files and all my applications. When I had my PC bare almost as if it was just reinstalled then... guess what I still didnt have enough hard drive space to have Dropbox sync all my updates directory and file moves no new filesOK I thought Ill quit dropbox now that I know how crappy it is and Ill be ok. But noooo I cannot download it in that state  in the middle of syncing  I get errors.I either accept that I lost 1 Terabyte worth of data or Dropbox will just keep charging me indefinitely for their bugs month after month. Dropbox just really dropped the box on this one. Support Nobody has been bothering to reply and assist me they are just waiting for their next ransom money.

The cancelation is not taking effect until the following year. I have attempted to contact any customer service rep via email chat and phone no phone available and no customer service rep has responded or is available the closest I got was a sales rep who closed the chat and ignored the query after giving me a link to their blog. This is the quintessential example of horrible customer service.

We kindly request users to upgrade their OS to a newer version Me: I cantIm a recording studio and my software are dedicated to that OSTroy are you here Troy: Yes Me: :Troy: Unfortunately this is the end of support for these operating systems :slightlyfrowningface: Me: Then i have a very expensive  Business DB that dont work Troy: The plan will continue to work but we will have to ask you to use a newer version of the OS or through our web portal Me: If I use the web portal then the hole ide og  easy sync cloud acces are GONE Thats not a good solutionTroy: We regularly release new versions of the Dropbox application with additional features better performance and security enhancements and these are not always compatible with older systems. Me: This is the first time I have seen itI payed something like 400 for this DB plan This is not an ok solution for meTroy: We had sent our first communication about ending support for certain OS in July/August 2017.

Troy: I am unable to provide a refund for the purchase in question.  Me: WhyTroy: The product is still a working product.

Naufal Esbhani,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,The best external storage device,Being a manager I have to send a lot of files to my colleagues and supervisors. Files which take a lot of storage space. This is when Dropbox comes to my rescue. I can send my desired people a Dropbox link through which they can then download the file. This Dropbox link could even be made sure that only relevant people can view or download the information by granting access to only these people ensuring maximum security. Yearly subscription cost is even not much and is totally worth it for my company.
frances bradshaw,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,BEWARE,BEWARE  I had a free version of Dropbox I was trying at my very small program.  However it kept having syncing issue with the other person.  After talking to Dropbox I was told that if I upgraded to the business version all the files on my free version would migrate over.  THEY DID NOT.  I only noticed it because after many many hours and days on chat to get it to work correctly my office manager could see the folders.  UNFORTUNATELY she could not see all the folders.  Now after many emails  they only send you links on how to find the missing folders yourself.  If your business is very busy . . . . . perhaps moving to business Dropbox is not a good idea.  Unless you have hours to go back through all your folders to make sure they all make it before Dropbox deletes them.

Anastasia,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Free cheese is in the mouse trap..,Free cheese is in the mouse trap... In the process of a refund now so may be a case of 0 stars depending on how that goes As many below subscribed completely carelessly in a few clicks to a 30 day free trial on Business Account we have 2 staff from a Standard free account which I have been using for years kind of and forgot. Yesterday received an email congratulating us on upgrading to 5  accounts at 600  WHATIn shock and immediately looked up refunds and cancelations seems like for EU there is a 14 day refund period once charged I am really hoping and have filed both a ticket and sent an email directly.Literally praying they will refund and couldnt be more surprised to find out how unethical Dropbox are... So many questions in my head  why not notify me my trial is ending and ask me if I want to upgrade Why say you wont be charged now without saying you will be charged in 30 days Why have I been subscribed to 5 accounts when we only have 3 email accounts and 2 people across the whole company Why advertise at 150 when this wont be the case instead of the full sum per subscription Why isnt there a cooling off period when such large sums are involved Will definitely NEVER use Dropbox again and probably will never click on a free trial of anything ever in my life after this.

Admittedly I caught this 7 weeks late but when I queried this I was closed down.So avoid play the system get your mates to sign up for free and expand your space that way  or use other providers.

I made contact via the chat box and was directed to the web page for cancellation but there was no prompt box to tell me that I was successful.   The chat box person seemed to go to sleep on me so I was thinking that Id have to ring Dropbox. After about an hour I got an email from the customer services team who reassured me that Id receive a refund.  This was a headache I couldve done without  NEVER AGAIN
Kevin Eckhart,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/59931c8f0000ff000abc254b/73x73.png,No Location,1 star: Bad,Charged for entire year for 3.5 weeks of service on auto renew error,We closed a business and found out that we had a Dropbox account on autobilling with a 99 yearly auto renew when we received our credit card statement. Although we had not logged in for nearly six months since the business closed its Dropboxs policy to refuse refunds of any auto renewal charges however recent the renewal charge was. They could have charged us for one month but chose to hit us for the full year. When I tried to chat with them on their online chat window as soon as she found out it was a complaint she promptly ended the chat session. Their customer handling is horrific. Had this have been handled properly I would likely have gone to them for future business needs. Not anymore. There are many choices for cloud storage these days. They think they can mistreat their customers but it will catch up with them. AVOID You have many other choices Meanwhile I can highly recommend Hostmonster. We had the same situation with them and they immediately refunded the entire amount. I will be using them again and already know Ill have the need for another website.

Customer,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Good tech but appalling commercial practice,Their technology is good  but not unique. Last year I made the mistake of accidentally clicking annual rather than monthly billing. This didnt suit my cash flow and is less flexible so immediately called to correct it. They absolutely refused to make the change as its a business account. This year they gave just 3 days notice of the renewal. 2 of those days were a weekend.  Their website doesnt allow me to make a change to downgrade to monthly billing so I spent 20 minutes on the phone to arrange this.  They requested confirmation by email and guess what Theyve ignored that and recharged the full annual amount.

Christian Grnning,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,No customer service at all  only a stupid robot,DropBox has absolutely NO customer service Up until recently I simply loved Dropbox and would recommend it to everyone. However that is no longer the case. Recently Dropbox reset the password for one of my accounts and now I cannot regain access to my account. Leaving a wide range of personal files and family photos out of reach  perhaps forever. Having now tried to contact customer service twice to explain my issue I am repeatedly answered with a generic email with a bunch of links to places online which do not address my problem or solve it.So if there is an actual person out there and not just a robot. And if Dropbox would like to keep me and my business as a happy client then please get in touch with me and help me out. I estimate that this problem will take about 5 minutes so solve and it would mean the world to me. Regards from a disappointed client

I replied confirming that the system requirements were met.Heard nothing back from them since three weeks now. Sent three chasing emails since. Still nothing. Left with no other choice than to move provider.Fine when it works. If it doesnt tough youre on your own but theyll still take your money.

Tina Nrgaard,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Drlig service og bondefangeri,Da min gratis Dropbox var blevet for lille skulle det opgraderes. Der var et stort spring i den mngde data man kunne have liggende s nste step var meget stor  langt strre end jeg havde behov for. Og ret dyr. Men fik mig meldt til. F dage efter fortrd jeg da jeg fandt andre muligheder p nettet en lsning der passede bedre til mit behov og meget billigere. Jeg gik derfor ind p Dropboxs hjemmeside for at nedgradere igen og skrev samtidig i en tekstboks at da det var inden for de 14 dage hvor jeg kunne fortryde og f pengene retur var det det jeg nskede. For at sikre mig at de fik beskeden sendte jeg 12 dage efter en mail  her svarede jeg retur p den bekrftelsesmail ang. nedgradering jeg havde fet. Bare for en sikkerheds skyld. Skrev her at jeg havde skrevet samme besked p deres hjemmeside og bad dem bekrfte.Jeg fik intet svar.Skrev igen nu via deres hjemmeside der i vrigt ikke er helt nem at overskue.Efter lidt tid fik jeg svar at de ikke kunne give mig pengene retur.Skrev igen. Fik samme svar. Og at de ikke kunne se jeg havde skrevet via deres hjemmeside. Skulle jeg have pengene retur skulle jeg bevise at jeg havde givet besked inden for tidsfristen.Skrev igen og videresendte de emails jeg havde sendt. Den besked jeg sendte via deres hjemmeside kunne jeg af gode grunde ikke sende.Fik svar at jeg desvrre havde svaret p en noreply emailadresse s de kunne ikke give mig pengene retur. Selvom det tydeligt fremgik at jeg rent faktisk havde sendt dem besked. Men nej. Forkert adresse. Og jeg havde endda vret opmrksom p om der p mailen stod noget om at den ikke kunne besvares men det havde jeg ikke kunnet se. Fr bagefter. For selve adressen hed noget med noreply. Ellers tror jeg ikke der stod noget.Nu skal det jo s ogs siges at mailen kun var ekstra sikkerhed for jeg startede jo ud med at skrive til dem p den side der var beregnet og jeg fik jo rent faktisk besked om at de havde modtaget min opsigelse. Jeg kunne bare ikke bevise at jeg ogs havde skrevet omkring returnering af pengene i samme omgang.S lukkede Dropbox min sag og jeg kunne heller ikke give nogen sur smiley.Nu hnger jeg s p Dropbox i et r. Det kalder jeg ren bondefangeri. Meget meget besvrligt at komme i kontakt med dem p rette vis benbart og uanset at jeg faktisk delvist kunne dokumentere mit forsg p at skrive til dem ville de ikke returnere pengene. Telefonisk kontakt var ikke muligt heller ikke selvom jeg bad om det.S pas p Srg for at kunne dokumentere de ting du gr.

Imagine the horror when I was told that its only possible to retrieve files 30 days after it happened. Anything that precedes the 30 day mark youll never be able to retrieve again And then the customer service representative proceeded to tell me to ensure that this would never happen again if I upgraded to dropbox business instead. I would have upgraded to dropbox business IF I had gotten all my files back that accidentally got deletedThe only thing I can do now is sit back and cry over the loss of the majority files which included PPTs notes endless amounts of research papers and other important presentations Ive done during my bachelor degree Its clear to me that if youre a free user of dropbox youre gonna get screwed over unless youre a premium user they wont take the time to help you out. Ive now decided to use another online storage solution thats NOT dropbox
Pierre Schou,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Dropbox has ZERO customer support,After 3 seperate attempts at getting ahold of customer support no one has responded the only humans i can find in dropbox are the ones selling Buisness accounts and they are apprently not allowed to pass on a message to another department.As a paying customer with software solutions that is not working as advertised this is simply not acceptable. The Support system is a round about of FAQ and the contact formulars dont respond 95 of the time and the 5 that comes threw never gets a reply.AVOID AT ALL COST

Ren,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Nem lsning som virker,Har betalt for at have 1tb p Dropbox i et par mneder nu uden noget som helst bvl. Eneste minus er at de ikke har en 100gb 200gb eller 500gb lsning men enten gratis som er hvad 23gb 1tb eller firma. S selvom jeg kun udnytter f.eks. 50 gb betaler jeg for 1000gb. Det er dog stadigvk billigt 7080 kroner om mneden eller 700800 kroner for et r og er bestemt det vrd s man ikke mister sine vigtige filer.
DS,NO photo,No Location,2 stars: Poor,Just hope you dont need any help. Company not reachable,When its working dropbox is great. Simply it syncs folders across all your enrolled devices and it lets you share files with anyone online. Very handy.BUT... if you have a problem forget about it. Recently my dropbox started to fill up so they started sending me emails about upgrading. When I clicked the links in the emails they were all broken and took me to a Error 500 page. This referred me to their Customer Help Center. This is the most convoluted help center Ive ever seen. If you do a search with the terms Error 500 you get a long list of results NONE of which reference the Error 500. So you click through the links and get to a spot where you can submit a support request. This is basically an email submission and allow 1  3 business days for a response. Long story short Dropbox doesnt even offer chat service. They do not want to talk to their customers. If I can find a company with telephone support Im switching.
Kevin Ghler,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/4d9b553f000064000107acf2/73x73.png,DK,2 stars: Poor,Down hill,Ive been using dropbox for years now and Its always been rather smooth.But today I ran out of space as happens and I went to upgrade my account. But apparently you cant buy any more than 1 TB of space.I contacted support and the help was lousy to say the mildest. It started out with a couple of copypaste answers clearly demonstrating that my initial message was never read.After finally understanding my issue the support employee told me that it was not possible to buy any more space without upgrading to a business account. After this the employee told me to have a good day and logged off..What kind of company does not want to sell some extra space for double the money That is pretty sillyI guess Ill now have to spend hours cleaning my dropbox so that I can sync this temporary workstation before leaving school and thus having to wipe the workstation. sigh

Manfred,NO photo,No Location,3 stars: Average,Very bad security,Im using Dropbox since 2 years now but my problem is that the security is not that good. There are some other providers out here who im going to use in the future. Also Dropbox does not add some really new features over the time. Im currently using Your Secure Cloud and im very happy.
Pim van Dalen,NO photo,No Location,3 stars: Average,Top Functionaliteit maar zeer onveilig,Inmiddels heb ik nog veel meer topfunctionaliteit gevonden bij een veel beter beveiligde Cloudopslagleverancier in Zwitserland: SecureSafe van DSwiss AG.

In 30 days from now Im going to lose that extra space. That means Im going back to what I had before and I cant live without the 23 GB extra I have now. Unfortunately you dont offer 30GB for free like OneDrive does so I have decided to drop Dropbox because I dont want to pay for something I can get for free somewhere else. I hope one day Dropbox will follow OneDrive and give more space for free and when that happens I will maybe comeback.Kind RegardsUlrik Ulmer

I particularly like the two factor authentication. We also find the version history to be hugely useful.
Hadia Al,NO photo,GB,4 stars: Great,Brilliant,I have been using Dropbox for for about 3 years and more now i was so lucky to get 50gb with my phone but it unfortunately expired now but thats not a problem. I accidentally deleted a bunch of folders the other day and i almost got a heart attack as i thought it was all gone. but then my husband showed me the restore bin files and I was amazed. i restored all my deleted files and it saved my life. Verdict I would recommend this to anyone and everyone 
rob b,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Useful from Educational Hobby or Professional,Ive used Dropbox to carry out projects across a variety of working environments. From Educational grad school personal projects like multimedia or family sharing and also in my work.Dropbox is an efficient and useful way to move files between multiple devices. The syncing is quick and the notifications are super helpful.Another great thing about Dropbox is that I know my data is doublebaked up in their cloud. It isnt my only point of backup but at the very least I know Im not going to lose a file if it is in the dropbox and my laptop get stolen or some other malady.Ive shared files with countless people at this point using folders on dropbox. No other product delivers as simply and nicely as this for file sharing.
Anna Szulc,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,Drop Box  NO customer service,There is no customer service. We paid for upgrade storage for our company and we received no help when needed it. We had a snow storm in Maine and it took them 3 weeks to get any help which still did not resolved our issue  There is 8552376726 but they wont help you. This is a sale phone  that only will accept call for new accounts
Robert Wood,NO photo,No Location,1 star: Bad,It Use to be good,I loved dropbox and was happy to pay their fees for a couple of years. Late last year I upgraded Windows 8 and downloaded Dropbox expecting to see the drop box folder and be able to open my work files and begin working away. Thats not the way it works anymore. There is no folder and all the files seem to be stored in the cloud. They do have instructions on how to add the folder but they didnt work for me  and there is NO Customer support beyond that except to send an email. I keep paying their fees because there seems to be no way out. If you log onto their website there doesnt seem to be anyway to manage your account. You can send an email and wait I suppose. Maybe Im just old  yes I am  but I would really like to have my files on my computer because once in a while Im I an airplane and need to work or Im away from home and not at Starbucks or McDonalds.Ive switched to Copy as it seems to be what Dropbox used to be. Im sure there are lots of other sites that work as well so no particular recommendation. There is always thumb drive sneaker net and sadly I have to recomend that as a much better alternative than DropBox.

I highly recommend Dropbox for both professional and personal use.
Dennis Pham,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Easy flexible featurerich and accessible,Ive been using Dropbox Google Drive and Box over the last 3 years. Dropbox has been the fastest easiest to setup and easiest to share with my friends family and fiance because of its interface and apps for iPhones iPads Samsung S5 Mac and PCs. Servicewise their responses to my questions have been quick and thorough and to be honest much of the site is selfexplanatory. A good bar for Google Drive and Box to strive far in my opinion.

Everyone should use Dropbox
Harsh V,NO photo,US,5 stars: Excellent,A musthave utility on every device you own,Dropbox quickly and seamlessly syncs my files between all of my devices and allows me to be productive whether Im at my desk in office or leaning back on my couch. With Dropbox installed on all any device any concern over data loss is well and truly vanquished. As a product Dropbox is approaching email levels of importance if it isnt there already. Just as you can guarantee an email recipient will see your message Dropbox guarantees your files will be where you need them when you need them without exception.

But unless you want to share some small amount of files you can forget it. They keep suspending your account for no reason. At the begining we were using free service.But when we share some files our share links keeps being suspended due to over traffic then we bought one year pro account. Believe or not although you got over 110GB spacealtough they said pro account is 200GB data allowance per day and you paid for their service your download links still be suspended without even a notice Now its a week since suspending we sent their emails not even get a single reply Poor service dont know why people use this shit now our customers are annoyed we have to pay again to find another hosting and upload our data again And they dont refund me even we down graded our account We paid for a none working account WTF

But the folder does not show up  i have only got the option to start sharing.I looked in their support articles for help and found how to leave a shared folder.Unfortunatly that only worked if the shared folder actually showed up. Which it does not.After a lot of trouble i found a place where i could write a message to a person.I explain the above. And get a reply linking me to the support article that does not work for me.I reply to that email informing the supporter that it does not solve the problem.And that i want to leave the folder.No reply.

Ib Juncker,NO photo,DK,5 stars: Excellent,Genial til deling af fotos og lig.,Jeg har nu brugt dropboxen til at dele filer mellem 2 computere. Ingen problemer super. Man skal dog lige huske at hvis man ogs bruger dropboxen p mobilen er det en god ide at f filerne ned mens man er p hjemme ntvrket ellers kan det godt vre trgt hvis der er strrere mngder data lagt op.Men bedst af alt er den til at dele fotos og filer. Billeder og filer deles nemt ved at ligge en kopi i dropboxen hvor efter man kan maile et link til at hente billederne til alle man nsker at dele dem med. Der kan gives adgang til enkelt fil eller mappe hvor dem man s har mailet linket til kan se og enda downloade de filer og billeder de gerne vil ha til eget brug.2GB kommer gratis og hvis man s er flittig med at invitere andre til at bruge dropbox kan man komme op p 16GB hvor det stadig er gratis.Det svarrer til ca. 4000 billeder.Fed program ganske enkelt.

They work for most platforms currently I use it for Linux Windows and Android and its been beautifully integrated with each and every system Ive used it with.My only problem with DropBox is that it doesnt offer as much security as Id like to. DropBox has been in the media several times with security issues and that is what makes me give them 4 stars.Even though Im thinking about getting a subscription with more space. But I will never used DropBox to store anything too personal.Overall a great product.

Det er hurtigt og nemt. Ville nske der var lidt mere gratis plads selvom det sikkert heller ikke ville vre nok Men top karakter herfra.

Alex,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Nemt at dele med andre,Nemt at komme igang med at bruge ogs nemt hvis man vil dele noget med andre.
Anne Lauritsen,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/4c3d980e00006400010373bb/73x73.png,DK,5 stars: Excellent,Nemt,Jeg bruger dropbox til online backup af billeder og vigtige dokumenter. Jeg har kbt 100GB plads for 20/mdr. Det er ret billigt i forhold til hvad div. danske hjemmeside krver i betaling.Jeg bruger dog ikke selve programmet men udfrer al upload og download via deres hjemmeside og det virker upklageligt. Kan klart anbefales
Thomas,NO photo,DK,5 stars: Excellent,Ingen problemer ingen udgifter,Det virker helt fantastisk og koster intet

Henrik Hansen,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/493c3a47000064000100953e/73x73.png,DK,4 stars: Great,Ahh det virker bare,Dropbox fungerer og det gr mange ting meget lettere Slut med at huske at kopiere alt muligt til en USBpind eller emaile dokumenter frem og tilbage.Til gengld kunne jeg rigtig godt tnke mig muligheden for at kunne vlge at nogle mapper ikke synkroniseres til internettet men kun imellem computerne. Det er sikkert ikke konceptet men kunne man det fik Dropbox 5 stjerner

Pernille,NO photo,DK,4 stars: Great,Virker som det skal.,Jeg behver ikke at tnke p at lave backup mere dropbox klare det hele konstant. Og s har jeg altid adgang til mine billeder osv. lige meget hvem jeg besger. Desuden kan jeg godt lide at backuppen af mine filer ligger p nettet og ikke i hjemmet hvor en gud for byde det brand ville de ligge bde orginal fil og backup fil.

Nick,NO photo,No Location,5 stars: Excellent,Ingen problem med betalinger,Efter at have vret betalende kunde flere gange m jeg konstatere at det fungerer som det skal. Det er super let at hoppe af hvis man ikke vil med lngere og man bliver ikke efterflgende generet med henvendelser om at betale igen.
Askild W.,NO photo,No Location,4 stars: Great,Crossplatform fildeling sync og backup der virker fint fint,Man kan benytte dropbox p forskellige mder men generelt handler det om at have samling p og nem adgang til filer p tvrs af platforme. Jeg benytter Dropbox via klient p OSX WinXP Win7beta og Ubuntu. Bde for at have adgang til filerne fra forskellige maskiner men ogs som en ekstra backup. Enkelte gange har der ogs vret brug for at tilg filerne via web p en fremmed maskine. Jeg har valgt ikke at arbejde direkte i dropbox mappen men tilfjer i stedet filer efter behov. Det fungere efter hensigten.Man fr 2GB gratis som bruger men kan pt. opn 10GB ved at lokke venner i butikken refferals. Derudover kan man tilkbe ved behov for meget plads.
Michael,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/48cbdbca0000640001005b89/73x73.png,DK,5 stars: Excellent,Virker bare perfekt Mac  iPhone,Har brugt Dropbox i et rs tid og er blevet s glad for det at jeg har kbt en 50 GB konto. Brugte den simpelhen s meget at de gratis 2 GB ikke var nok. De 2 GB vil dog sikkert dkke de flestes behov.Jeg bruger de p 2 Macr og en iPhone og det virker perfekt. Ikke en eneste fejl har jeg oplevet.
Hoder Jensen,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/46d2e5b80000640001000202/73x73.png,DK,5 stars: Excellent,Gratis og let service der billigt kan opgraderes,Dropbox tilbyder gratis 2GB online plads som let og automatisk kan synkroniseres imellem flere computere. Har man brug for mere plads s er det ikke specielt dyrt at opgradere sin konto.
