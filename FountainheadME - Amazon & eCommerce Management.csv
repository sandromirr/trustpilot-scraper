Irl Cramer,NO photo,US,3 stars Average,This company is not for everyone,This company is not for everyone certainly wasnt for me. I worked with them for about 6 weeks and they did solve one problem for me but it cost a fortune for them to do it.  The overwhelming experience I had was that Fountainheads main objective was to charge me as much as they could as fast as they could and to leverage their knowledge to help themselves not me.  There are two of their practices I found very greedy and problematic. When they give a quote it specifically disclaims any promise of success. Its in the nature of well try but we promise nothing. And one of the worst is that when they put up a quote they assume after 24 hours that you have accepted it. Not good.  OK one final thing....I had a specific problem but they required that I let them go through at my expense an analysis of what I needed. From this evaluation they then made suggestions for very expensive fixes they would like to do. I felt a little like they were just hunting for way to find work rather than trying to help me. Overall they are more in it for themselves than they are for the customer and if you dont play it their way the environment becomes adversarial.  I did not get value for what I paid.

Maryam Tahir,NO photo,CA,5 stars Excellent,Loved working with FountainheadME.,Every individual that Ive spoken to at FoundheadME has been extremely kind understanding and most importantly VERY knowledgable about their field. Ive had extremely bad experiences in the past working with quite a few different companies and Ive always felt that theyve tried to take advantage of my lack of experience in the ecommerce business. When I came across Jeffs company I felt like I found the right fit for me. They went above and beyond to do everything in their power to fulfill my needs as a business owner and were always extremely transparent about where my money is going and what the results are. A special shout out to Tara Ward my personal account manager. She is phenomenal. I cannot wait to continue to work with FoundheadME in the future. Cant recommend them enough

Spent many thousands of dollars for worse outcome.  I think they could bring value if you are BRAND new to Amazon and simply have no idea what you are doing.  Would not recommend to companies with even a mediocre understanding.If you choose to go with them I recommend speaking with at least 3 of their clients.  Their reviews seem questionable on here based on my experience.

Outwater,NO photo,US,5 stars Excellent,Responsiveness  responsibility  results,Scott was my rep either I got lucky or everybody at this company is stellar at what they do. He was a pleasure to work with not only took direction well but added his own style to the marketing material that elevated my listings and sales to the next level. I also like their pricing structure youre not charged for work that isnt completed. No monthly fees where some months things get done and others they dont. Every dime I spent with FME was spent towards working on my account. Cant wait for this Pandemic to end so we can get back to it
