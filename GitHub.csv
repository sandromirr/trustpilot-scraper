Allen,NO photo,GB,3 stars: Average,Steep learning curve,I want to store my source code safely transferring from SVN but this is a really steep learning curve.  It might well be great eventually but they could do more to support newcomers.

I always rely on GitHub with my downloads and links. Currently I am teaching my friend how to code basic programs. Whenever she needs an example or source I just give her a GitHub download. GitHub is COMPLETELY safe. Ive downloaded over 20 items on GitHub and I havent gotten any threats. Nice website
Karl Malin,NO photo,GB,1 star: Bad,A complete mess of an interface,If you want a lesson in terrible UI look no further than here. Who doesnt spend time hunting around for the information they want. Its a shame so many developers use it.

MovieTrekker HQ,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/5f56f215fb6952507d5b5b36/73x73.png,US,5 stars: Excellent,High profile convenient and professional,I had a paid GitHub account and converted it to free and have several other free accounts.  For both my tech startups and for my open source projects GitHub is great because it is so high profile.  Everybody knows about GitHub.  It isnt easy to get a good username but once you find one it feels like its for life.  I really feel that the promotional value of GitHub is much more valuable than the less known competitors.

Loyal Customer,NO photo,US,1 star: Bad,GitHub Scumbag Thieves,I had an account registered since 2012 and was deployed overseas in military for over a year. Someone came along and wanted my account name so they changed the name of my GitHub which was also my side business and completely screwed me. They never even attempted to notify me or anything of the sort. This is wrong on so many levels they said it was their policy to do this when an account wasnt active for over a year. I finally gave up trying to get me precious name back and since it is their supposed policy I found another account that was not active for over a year like mine. When I requested the name they simply ignored me and dont respond to my requests. These people can go to hell because they know what they did was and is wrong.

Md. Abu Taher,https://userimages.trustpilot.com/5dcaff0de71f3355510946aa/73x73.png,BD,4 stars: Great,Its almost the standard,Good Points: Been using github for so many years. Its almost the standard for git. Now they added package registry and actions as well. Super useful.Bad points: The slow internet speed sometimes with aws cache in my region. It becomes super slow even with some npm install command imagine 1KB/s. Sometimes I feel if the collaborator limit was 5 people rather than three it would be awesome. Because sometimes 3 people is not enough for some small homework.
Alex,NO photo,CA,1 star: Bad,Not experiencing good customer support with Github,We have an organization account on GitHub. I made a ticket for my issue on GitHub. But either they dont reply or their reply is not helpful. The person answering me probably doesnt know how to fix our issue. They dont have a phone number that we can call.Our problem is not fixed after a month.If customer service matters to your business we recommend you to avoid GitHub.
